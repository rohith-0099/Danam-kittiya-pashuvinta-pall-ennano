### Project Description
A hilariously useless web application that uses computer vision and machine learning to count cow teeth in uploaded photos‚Äîdeliberately violating the ancient Malayalam wisdom that advises against examining the teeth of a gifted cow.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Our wise ancestors gave us the proverb "‡¥¶‡¥æ‡¥®‡¥Ç ‡¥ï‡¥ø‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥ø‡¥Ø ‡¥™‡¥∂‡µÅ‡¥µ‡¥ø‡µª‡µç‡¥±‡µÜ ‡¥™‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤‡µÅ ‡¥®‡µã‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÄ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡µÅ ‡¥ï‡¥æ‡¥∞‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥Æ‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤" (Don't look at the teeth of a gifted cow), but what if we want to count them anyway? What if we need to know EXACTLY how many teeth that cow has? This burning question has kept humanity awake at night for centuries.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a cutting-edge AI system that uses advanced computer vision to detect, count, and analyze cow teeth with unnecessary precision. Our ML model provides and calculates your exact Confidence Level
## Technical Details

*üîÅ A majestic journey from cow photo to utterly meaningless metrics. The image is uploaded, processed, and analyzed for cow "teeth" using OpenCV. These teeth (or whatever the algorithm believes are teeth) are counted and run through fake machine learning logic to generate hilariously useless results like "Confident level"

Step 1: User Interface (Streamlit)

Clean, intuitive web interface with file uploader
Malayalam proverb displayed prominently at the top
Signature upload button decorated with cow emoji üêÑ
Responsive design that works on all devices

Step 2: Image Processing Pipeline

Image Reception: Streamlit handles uploaded image files seamlessly
Grayscale Conversion: OpenCV transforms images for analysis
Teeth Detection: Advanced thresholding techniques detect white regions (your precious teeth!)
Contour Analysis: Sophisticated algorithms identify tooth-like shapes and count them

Step 3: "AI Analysis" (Fake but Hilariously Accurate)

Tooth Counting: Counts detected white blobs as individual teeth
Confidence Scoring: Generates convincingly random confidence percentages
Proverb Violation Calculator: Measures how much you're disappointing your Malayalam ancestors

Step 4: Results Generation

Visual Overlay: Numbers each detected tooth on your original image
Humorous Analysis: Displays entertaining charts and statistics
Ancestral Disappointment Meter: Shows exactly how much shame you've brought to your family
Shareable Results Card: Generate beautiful cards to share your dental destiny with friends

### Project Description
A hilariously useless web application that uses computer vision and machine learning to count cow teeth in uploaded photos‚Äîdeliberately violating the ancient Malayalam wisdom that advises against examining the teeth of a gifted cow.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Our wise ancestors gave us the proverb "‡¥¶‡¥æ‡¥®‡¥Ç ‡¥ï‡¥ø‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥ø‡¥Ø ‡¥™‡¥∂‡µÅ‡¥µ‡¥ø‡µª‡µç‡¥±‡µÜ ‡¥™‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤‡µÅ ‡¥®‡µã‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µÄ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡µÅ ‡¥ï‡¥æ‡¥∞‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥Æ‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤" (Don't look at the teeth of a gifted cow), but what if we want to count them anyway? What if we need to know EXACTLY how many teeth that cow has? This burning question has kept humanity awake at night for centuries.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a cutting-edge AI system that uses advanced computer vision to detect, count, and analyze cow teeth with unnecessary precision. Our ML model provides and calculates your exact Confidence Level
## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages: Python, HTML, CSS (via Streamlit)
- Frameworks: Streamlit (Web App Framework)

*üîÅ A majestic journey from cow photo to utterly meaningless metrics. The image is uploaded, processed, and analyzed for cow "teeth" using OpenCV. These teeth (or whatever the algorithm believes are teeth) are counted and run through fake machine learning logic to generate hilariously useless results like "Confident level"

Step 1: User Interface (Streamlit)

Clean web interface with file uploader

Malayalam proverb displayed prominently

Upload button with cow emoji

Step 2: Image Processing Pipeline

Streamlit receives uploaded image file

OpenCV converts image to grayscale

Image thresholding to detect white regions (teeth)

Contour detection to identify tooth-like shapes

Step 3: "AI Analysis" (Fake but Funny)

Count detected white blobs as "teeth"

Generate random confidence scores

Create fake dental metrics and personality profiles

Calculate "proverb violation level"

Step 4: Results Generation

Overlay numbered teeth on original image

Display humorous analysis with charts

Show ancestral disappointment meter

Generate shareable results card
